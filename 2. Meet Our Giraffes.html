      <h2>Frankie</h2>
      <p>
        Frankie can't get his day started on a good note until he's had his bowl
        of grass! He tends to share his food with his pal Coconut.

      <h2>Coconut</h2>
      <p>
        Coconut likes to start her day with a bowl of water and a nice serving
        of grass to go with it! While Coconut enjoys Frankie sharing his food
        with her she does not like sharing her food with him.
