      <h2>Earl</h2>
      <p>
        Earl is as calm as a monkey can be. He likes to spend his days laying on the
        grass and soaking in all the sunlight he can get.

      <h2>Banana Pudding</h2>
      <p>
        While her name may sound sweet Banana Pudding is a pretty tough lady.
        Everyone knows better than to get on her bad side or they'll get taught a
        lesson!
